## Yarn
__Fast, reliable and secure dependency management tool__

Node.js includes NPM. You can choose to use NPM or Yarn.

```bash
yarn add [package]
```

Installing all of the dependencies of a project

yarn install
```

or 

```bash
yarn
```

Running package.json scripts
```bash
yarn [script]
```

__example__
```bash
yarn start
```

## Git

Copy a repo to your local machine
```git
git clone <url>
```

Find out the status of all your files
```git
git status
```

Bring the code down from your repository
```git
git pull <remote> <branch>

git pull origin master
```

Add all of your changes to be committed
```git
git add -a .
```

Commit your changes to the version history
```git
git commit -m "My cool new version"
```

Push your changes up to the remote
```git
git push <remote> <branch>

git push origin master
```

## Ionic

### Installation

Enter the following command in terminal (make sure you have the lastest version of node.js installed)
```bash
npm install -g ionic
```

::: tip
The -g means it is a global install. For Windowâ€™s it's recommended to open an Admin command prompt. For Mac/Linux, run the command with sudo.
:::

## Ionic CLI

### Version

First check the version of Ionic you have just installed
```bash
ionic --version
```

### Creating project

Enter the following command in terminal
```bash
ionic start name-of-your-app
```

::: tip
Assuming your working directory (current directory your terminal is pointing to) is `/Users/me/Documents/ix/full-stack`, the above command would create a new project folder as follows: `/Users/me/Documents/ix/full-stack/name-of-your-app`.
:::

### Run app

Run locally (localhost:8100)
```bash
cd name-of-your-app
ionic serve
```

The browser should open automatically to localhost:8100. If it doesn't, then manually open up your browser and navigate to localhost:8100.


## Open in VSCode

### Open in VSCode

Open up another terminal and `cd` into the project. Type the following command to open the project in Visual Studio Code.
```bash
cd name-of-your-app
code .
```

::: warning
In the previous step we ran `ionic serve` in our terminal. This terminal window is not listening for anymore commands as it is busy serving our Ionic project with a built-in server (more on that later). Therefore, you need to open up a new terminal window (NOTE: you can have many tabs in Terminal on Mac).
:::

::: tip
Alternatively, open up Visual Studio Code manually and open the folder through the app by going to `File > Open...` and selecting your new Ionic project.

}
```

::: tip scripts
The scripts section of the file allows us to add custom commands. For example, we can run `npm run start`, which will then trigger the above `ng serve` command. This is handy for re-usable commands shared across the project.
:::

::: tip dependencies and devDependencies
The above dependencies are installed by running `npm install`. Ionic does this for us automatically. You can find these dependencies inside the `node_modules` folder inside the project.
